subtitle: Identifying specific cancer subtypes associated with high levels of environmental pollutant exposure
---


Air pollution is increasingly concerning due to an escalating number of catastrophic wildfires. However, what remains unclear is how air pollution is driving the development of lung cancer. As such, there is an urgent need to identify which pollutants are driving lung cancer and the mechanisms by which they are doing so. This project aims to identify specific pollutants, especially those that emerge as a result of climate change, that are associated with the incidence of lung cancer subtypes. We will also develop new methods to determine pollution exposure in lung samples.
