Epigenetic age is an estimate of the biological age of a given tissue or organ based on the levels of methylation at specific sites. When an individual’s epigenetic age is higher than their chronological age, they are said to be experiencing epigenetic age acceleration (EAA). This type of accelerated aging, which can be measured with ‘epigenetic clocks’ based on DNA methylation, has been associated with several adverse health outcomes, including cancer. However, it is still unclear what the causes and consequences of EAA in cancer are. The purpose of this study is to determine the clinical and molecular correlates of EAA in cancer by performing multi'omic profiling on cancer and normal tissues.
