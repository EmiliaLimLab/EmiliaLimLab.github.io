Theodora is a bioinformatician in the Lim Lab. She obtained her BSc at UBC with a combined major in microbiology and computer science. During that time, she developed an interest in bioinformatics through her work on various projects, including the assembly of the black spruce chloroplast genome during her co-op term in Dr. Inanc Birolâ€™s lab. She continued to pursue spruce genomics research during her MSc in bioinformatics degree, where she annotated the black spruce nuclear genome and provided insights on signatures related to biotic and abiotic stress adaptation. Now, in the Lim Lab, she hopes to apply her skills in next-generation sequencing data analysis to identify genome-wide molecular markers of aging.
